# aop-ontology
Ontology to manage adverse outcome pathways and associated data for predictive toxicology

##Description
The intent of the Adverse Outcome Pathway Ontology (AOPO) are to provide:
  * Semantic NoSQL way of accessing and managing Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOP)
  * Ways and means to facilitate computation on data within the OECD AOP-Wiki
  * Ways and means to standardize the lingua franca of the OECD AOP-Wiki
  * The data framework to enable the development of artificial intelligence for predictive toxicology
  * A central depository of toxicological knowledge to facilitate rapid and more efficient risk assessment

The AOPO consists of an OWL file that contains information from various sources. These sources currently include:
  * OECD AOP-Wiki
  * ChEBI (and its dependencies)
  * Human Phenotype Ontology (and its dependencies)
  * Bioassay Ontology (and its depenedencies)

Future sources will include:
  * NCBI PubChem
  * EPA ToxCast
  * NIH/FDA/EPA Tox21
  * Others (by nomination or that we identify)
